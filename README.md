## üîß Error Reporting & Monitoring System

This project includes a comprehensive error reporting and notification system:

### Features
- **Automatic Error Capture**: All client-side errors are automatically captured and reported

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full error context, stack traces, and user information
- **Resolution Tracking**: Mark errors as resolved and track progress

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Database Migration
The error reporting tables are already created via migration files. No additional setup needed.

#### 2. Configure Notification Webhooks

Add these environment variables to your Supabase project (Settings ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Environment Variables):

**Discord Notifications (Optional):**
```
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_url
```

**Slack Notifications (Optional):**
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your_webhook_url
```

**Email Notifications (Optional):**
```
# Using Resend (Recommended)
EMAIL_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
DEVELOPER_EMAIL=your_email@domain.com

# Alternative: SendGrid
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
DEVELOPER_EMAIL=your_email@domain.com

# Alternative: Mailgun
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain
DEVELOPER_EMAIL=your_email@domain.com

# Deploy the error webhook trigger function
supabase functions deploy error-webhook-trigger
```

#### 4. Set Up Database Webhook (Optional)

3. Enable the webhook

#### 5. Test Your Setup
1. Go to your app's Profile ‚Üí System Health tab
2. Use the Error Testing Panel to test different severity levels
3. Check your configured notification channels for test messages

### How It Works

1. **Error Capture**: All JavaScript errors, unhandled promise rejections, and resource loading failures are automatically captured
2. **Error Processing**: Errors are categorized by severity (low, medium, high, critical) and stored in the database
3. **User Experience**: Users see friendly error messages like "Something went wrong. Our team has been notified."
4. **Developer Notifications**: You receive detailed error reports via your configured channels (Discord, Slack, Email)
5. **Resolution Tracking**: Mark errors as resolved in the System Health dashboard

### Notification Triggers

- **Low Severity**: Logged only, no notifications
- **Medium Severity**: Notifications sent to configured channels
- **High Severity**: Immediate notifications sent
- **Critical Severity**: Urgent notifications + browser alerts

### Monitoring Dashboard

Access the System Health dashboard from Profile ‚Üí System Health to:
- View real-time system health status
- Browse and filter error reports
- Set up and test notification webhooks
- Test error reporting with different severity levels
- Export error data for analysis
