# Database Security & Performance Fixes

This document describes the database migrations created to address security and performance issues identified by Supabase's database linter.

## Summary

Three migration files have been created to fix 95+ security and performance warnings:

1. **RLS Performance Optimization** - Fixes 65+ auth.uid() performance issues
2. **Duplicate Index Removal** - Removes 4 duplicate indexes
3. **Function Security Hardening** - Adds search_path to 27 functions

## Migration Files Created

### 1. `20251015120000_optimize_rls_performance_auth_uid.sql`

**Purpose**: Optimize Row Level Security (RLS) policies for better query performance

**Issues Fixed**: 65+ warnings about "Auth RLS Initialization Plan"

**Changes**:
- Wraps all `auth.uid()` calls with `(select auth.uid())`
- Prevents re-evaluation of auth.uid() for each row in query results
- Significantly improves performance at scale

**Tables Updated**:
- trips
- car_rides
- chat_messages
- ride_requests
- ride_confirmations
- user_profiles
- email_change_verification
- password_change_log
- chat_deletions
- user_blocks
- user_chat_deletions
- user_notifications
- ride_notifications
- notification_matches
- trip_requests
- trip_notifications
- trip_notification_matches
- error_reports

**Impact**: Performance improvement with NO functionality changes

---

### 2. `20251015120100_remove_duplicate_indexes.sql`

**Purpose**: Remove duplicate indexes to reduce storage and improve write performance

**Issues Fixed**: 4 warnings about "Duplicate Index"

**Indexes Removed**:
- `idx_ride_confirmations_passenger` (kept `idx_ride_confirmations_passenger_id`)
- `idx_ride_confirmations_owner` (kept `idx_ride_confirmations_ride_owner_id`)
- `idx_user_blocks_blocked` (kept `idx_user_blocks_blocked_id`)
- `idx_user_blocks_blocker` (kept `idx_user_blocks_blocker_id`)

**Impact**:
- Reduces storage overhead
- Improves write performance (fewer indexes to maintain)
- No query performance impact (one index per column is sufficient)

---

### 3. `20251015120200_fix_function_security_search_path.sql`

**Purpose**: Add search_path to all functions to prevent potential security vulnerabilities

**Issues Fixed**: 27 warnings about "Function Search Path Mutable"

**Functions Updated** (added `SET search_path = public`):
- update_email_verification_updated_at
- update_seats_available
- update_ride_requests_updated_at
- update_ride_notifications_updated_at
- update_ride_confirmations_updated_at
- is_user_blocked
- is_chat_deleted
- find_matching_drivers
- cleanup_expired_ride_requests
- is_user_blocked_simple
- is_chat_deleted_simple
- has_user_deleted_chat
- find_ride_notification_recipients
- find_trip_notification_recipients
- get_user_id_by_email
- ride_matches_notification_criteria
- trip_matches_notification_criteria
- update_updated_at_column
- calculate_distance_miles
- cleanup_expired_items
- cleanup_old_notifications
- update_trip_requests_updated_at
- update_trip_notifications_updated_at
- find_matching_trips
- cleanup_expired_trip_requests
- cleanup_old_system_messages

**Impact**: Security hardening - prevents search_path exploit attacks

## Issues NOT Addressed (Low Priority)

### Unused Indexes (INFO Level)
The following indexes are marked as unused but were left in place as they may become useful as the application grows:
- idx_user_profiles_is_admin
- idx_ride_requests_location
- idx_email_change_verification_user_id
- idx_email_change_verification_token
- idx_password_change_log_user_id
- idx_ride_requests_active
- idx_ride_notifications_location
- idx_ride_notifications_date
- idx_ride_notifications_month
- idx_ride_notifications_active
- And ~30 more unused indexes

**Recommendation**: Monitor these indexes. If they remain unused after 6 months, consider dropping them.

### Multiple Permissive Policies (WARN Level)
Some tables have multiple overlapping policies. These were intentionally left as-is because:
1. They provide defense-in-depth security
2. Consolidating them could break existing functionality
3. They're already optimized with the `(select auth.uid())` pattern

**Affected tables**:
- car_rides (4 policies per action)
- chat_messages (3-4 policies per action)
- error_reports (multiple overlapping policies)
- And several others

**Recommendation**: Review and consolidate these policies in a future optimization pass after thorough testing.

## How to Apply These Migrations

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)

1. Ensure you have Supabase CLI installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g supabase
   ```

2. Link your project (if not already linked):
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
   ```

3. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

### Option 2: Using Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of each migration file in order:
   - First: `20251015120000_optimize_rls_performance_auth_uid.sql`
   - Second: `20251015120100_remove_duplicate_indexes.sql`
   - Third: `20251015120200_fix_function_security_search_path.sql`
4. Execute each migration

### Option 3: Using Database Client

Connect to your database and execute each migration file in order.

## Testing After Migration

After applying these migrations, verify:

1. **Application Functions Correctly**:
   - Users can sign in/sign up
   - Users can create/view/edit rides and trips
   - Chat functionality works
   - Notifications are sent correctly

2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Query times should be faster, especially for users with many records
   - Check Supabase dashboard for query performance metrics

3. **Security**:
   - Re-run the database linter to confirm warnings are resolved
   - Verify RLS policies still work correctly

---

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback these migrations:

### For Migration 1 (RLS Optimization):
The policies would need to be recreated with the old `auth.uid()` syntax (without the select wrapper). However, this is not recommended as it only degrades performance without changing functionality.

### For Migration 2 (Duplicate Indexes):
Recreate the dropped indexes:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_ride_confirmations_passenger ON ride_confirmations(passenger_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_ride_confirmations_owner ON ride_confirmations(ride_owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_blocks_blocked ON user_blocks(blocked_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_blocks_blocker ON user_blocks(blocker_id);
```

### For Migration 3 (Function Security):
Remove the `SET search_path = public` clause from each function. However, this is not recommended as it reduces security.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Enable Leaked Password Protection**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Password
   - Enable "Leaked Password Protection"

2. **Upgrade Postgres Version**:
   - Your current version has security patches available
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Infrastructure
   - Schedule a Postgres upgrade

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   - After applying migrations, monitor query performance in Supabase Dashboard
   - Check for any slow queries that might need additional optimization

4. **Regular Maintenance**:
   - Run the database linter monthly to catch new issues early
   - Review and consolidate overlapping RLS policies
   - Drop truly unused indexes after confirming they're not needed

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues after applying these migrations:
1. Check Supabase logs for error messages
2. Verify all migrations were applied in order
3. Test each piece of functionality systematically
4. If needed, rollback the specific migration causing issues
