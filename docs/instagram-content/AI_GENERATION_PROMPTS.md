## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON AI GENERATION ISSUES

### Issue: Characters look different between scenes
**Solution**: Use consistent prompt with exact same character descriptions. Save successful generations and reference them in future prompts. Use "seed" numbers for consistency in platforms that support it.

### Issue: Colors don't match brand guidelines
**Solution**: Always include hex codes in prompts (#2563EB, #16A34A, etc.). Specify "vibrant RideYaari brand blue" and add negative prompt "no purple, no violet, no indigo."

### Issue: Characters appear in 3D instead of 2D flat style
**Solution**: Emphasize "2D flat animation," "cel-shaded," "clean vector lines" in prompt. Add negative: "no 3D rendering, no realistic depth, no shadows."

### Issue: Vertical format not maintained
**Solution**: Explicitly state "9:16 aspect ratio," "Instagram Reels vertical format," "1080x1920 resolution" in every prompt. Some platforms need aspect ratio set separately from prompt.

### Issue: Voice doesn't match character personality
**Solution**: Use detailed voice direction including pitch adjustments (+/- semitones), speed multipliers (0.9x, 1.1x), and emotional tags (confident, confused). Regenerate until it matches.

### Issue: Animation is choppy or low quality
**Solution**: Request higher frame rates (60 fps), smooth motion, professional quality. Export at highest settings. May need to upscale using AI video enhancement tools.

### Issue: Text/captions not readable on mobile
**Solution**: Use minimum 48pt font size, add dark background box or stroke behind white text, keep text in lower third safe zone (150px from bottom).

### Issue: Background music too loud
**Solution**: Mix music at 30-40% during dialogue, 60-70% during text-only sections. Use audio ducking/compression. Normalize final mix to -14 LUFS for Instagram.
